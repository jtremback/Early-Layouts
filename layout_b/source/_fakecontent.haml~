    I was riding on the Mayflower
    %br
    When I thought I spied some land
    %br
    I yelled for Captain Arab
    %br 
    I have yuh understand
    %br 
    Who came running to the deck
    %br 
    Said, "Boys, forget the whale
    %br 
    Look on over yonder
    %br 
    Cut the engines
    %br 
    Change the sail
    %br 
    Haul on the bowline"
    %br 
    We sang that melody
    %br 
    Like all tough sailors do
    %br 
    When they are far away at sea

  %p
    "I think I'll call it America"
    %br 
    I said as we hit land
    %br 
    I took a deep breath
    %br 
    I fell down, I could not stand
    %br 
    Captain Arab he started
    %br 
    Writing up some deeds
    %br 
    He said, "Let's set up a fort
    %br 
    And start buying the place with beads"
    %br 
    Just then this cop comes down the street
    %br 
    Crazy as a loon
    %br 
    He throw us all in jail
    %br 
    For carryin' harpoons
