      I was riding on the Mayflower
      <br />
      When I thought I spied some land
      <br />
      I yelled for Captain Arab
      <br />
      I have yuh understand
      <br />
      Who came running to the deck
      <br />
      Said, "Boys, forget the whale
      <br />
      Look on over yonder
      <br />
      Cut the engines
      <br />
      Change the sail
      <br />
      Haul on the bowline"
      <br />
      We sang that melody
      <br />
      Like all tough sailors do
      <br />
      When they are far away at sea
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll call it America"
      <br />
      I said as we hit land
      <br />
      I took a deep breath
      <br />
      I fell down, I could not stand
      <br />
      Captain Arab he started
      <br />
      Writing up some deeds
      <br />
      He said, "Let's set up a fort
      <br />
      And start buying the place with beads"
      <br />
      Just then this cop comes down the street
      <br />
      Crazy as a loon
      <br />
      He throw us all in jail
      <br />
      For carryin' harpoons
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah me I busted out
      <br />
      Don't even ask me how
      <br />
      I went to get some help
      <br />
      I walked by a Guernsey cow
      <br />
      Who directed me down
      <br />
      To the Bowery slums
      <br />
      Where people carried signs around
      <br />
      Saying, "Ban the bums"
      <br />
      I jumped right into line
      <br />
      Sayin', "I hope that I'm not late"
      <br />
      When I realized I hadn't eaten
      <br />
      For five days straight
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into a restaurant
      <br />
      Lookin' for the cook
      <br />
      I told them I was the editor
      <br />
      Of a famous etiquette book
      <br />
      The waitress he was handsome
      <br />
      He wore a powder blue cape
      <br />
      I ordered some suzette, I said
      <br />
      "Could you please make that crepe"
      <br />
      Just then the whole kitchen exploded
      <br />
      From boilin' fat
      <br />
      Food was flying everywhere
      <br />
      And I left without my hat

        This song is brilliant. It really cracks me up. Basically, it is criticizing American culture, and comparing modern (1960's) America's appeal, or lack of, to the appeal of America during the time it was "discovered" by Colombus. It criticizes many aspects of beurocracy and America's unfriendly culture, and it's just great and subtle at the same time.

          Classic Dylan. I had a radio show in high school, played this or Ballad of a Thin Man every night. The style, sort of a stream of consciousness perspective is rarely matched against this. The genius of it; it combines incredible poetry, often profound, while at the same time disguising itself as absurdism, the likes of which could be compared to Franz Kafka. A deeper meaning, sometime quite mischievous, clouded behind an array of odd circumstances. Love it.

          the part about buying the place with beads refers to when the colonists bought Long Island from the Indians with beads, as that was their currency, which came out to about 24 american dollars

        Great, hilarious song. Definitely a funny criticism of American culture. I think my favorite part is when Dylan pulls down his pants when asked for collateral. Dylan just had a way with words.

        I can't believe there are not that many comments on this song it is amazing. I wasn't really into Bob Dylan but appreciated his contribution to music then I heard this and was blown away now I can't get enough of him. This song must have definetly been an influence on Nick Cave. Thats just my opinion anyway.

        This is the song that first got me into Dylan. The idea of a song being a surreal dreamlike tale was so new and appealing to me.
