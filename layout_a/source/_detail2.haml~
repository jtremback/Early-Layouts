      ZoSo028, I think the joke is actually that the Europeans 'discovered a New World', conveniently ignoring the fact that had already been discovered and colonised for centuries. He's imagining what might happen if another adventurer landed in the USA in the 1960s and claimed it, ignoring the 'natives' (modern day Americans). They want to buy the place with beads :-)

      That's how I see the song anyway. It's just a very silly idea while sniping at colonialism at the same time. Like the whole Arab/Ahab confusion, it's just played for laughs.
